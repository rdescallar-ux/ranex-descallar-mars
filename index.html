  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p> Hi, my name is Ranex Descallar. 
    I am a high school teacher at a STEM school in Hertford County, North Carolina. 
    I currently teach Computer Science and Drone Technology, and I have been doing so for almost three years and counting.
    I enrolled in this course to deepen my knowledge of coding so that I can share it with my students—especially those in my Computer Science classes. 
    I am genuinely enjoying the course so far, although it is also quite challenging as I work to balance my time between studying and preparing lessons for my students.
    Nevertheless, my passion for teaching and helping students grow is what motivates me to continue learning, and it is ultimately the reason why I am here.</p>
